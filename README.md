# Interview task
There are two tasks to be completed. I would expect this to take around 30 minutes.

### Task 1:
Navigate to https://aluminati.net, browse to the contact form, and fill out the form with whatever details you deem appropriate.

You will not be able to submit the form as it's behind a CAPTCHA, but simply filling out the data is enough for this excersise.

### Task 2
Task: In mobile view, browse to Our services -> Aluminate for education and get the value for every href on every anchor (<a> tag) on the page.
Output the href values to the console. Logging to cypress or the standard dev console is fine.

Please perform this entire task on the mobile site, including the navigation and link data fetching.

## Installing
Download follow the instructions [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Direct-download) to download/install cypress. This test is written with _direct installation_ in mind, but if you're more comfortable with a different method and you can make it work, you're welcome to do so.

The next step is to clone out test repo from INSERT LINK HERE. You should then be able to run cypress on this and get our basic setup.
